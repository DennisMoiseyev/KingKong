# King Kong
For my greyscale art scene, I wanted to implement black and white emojis to create
a horror theme. One of my favorite creature movies is *King Kong*. And Kong lives on
an isolated island known as Skull Island, hence the name. The numerous skulls in the background
are scattered in  a way that forms an island around Kong. Kong has an immense size and is present
front and center, acting as the centerpiece. To the right of him is a tall grey rectangular tower,
which depicts the infamous scene of him climbing the Empire State Building in New York. 

Here's an image that inspired my art:
